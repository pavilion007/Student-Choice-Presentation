                                                                How VR Will Change the Work Force
Many people have started to work at home due to the recent Covid-19 crisis. However, after the crisis is over, we still expect “25-30%” of the workforce to remain participating in stay at home work even after the crisis is over (Global Workplace Analytics). This brings new opportunities for VR in the work environment. Even though many people “think of video games and movies” when they think about VR, it can make an incredible impact on the workforce.
  Currently Companies such as Boeing and Raytheon are using virtual reality technology to simulate, develop, and design future technologies. They currently are using a “virtual reality product-simulation chamber called CAVE to help engineers and designers” have more interaction “with a digital prototype” (Patel). A Cave is an “automatic virtual environment” (TechoPedia). Each company uses a kind of cave to build their unique work environment. For example Boeing uses a CAVE that creates the exterior and interior of the planes they are working on. Using Virtual reality Boeing can design and walk through new commercial aircraft designs. This is important because customers can see the finished project before they even begin building the product. Walmart is another company that is using VR to train their workers. Walmart is “rolling out its VR program...to help train more than 1 million associates” (Morris). This large scale training session would be extremely expensive and almost impossible to do without using VR. In fact “several F500 companies...are folding virtual reality into worker education and training programs (Morris).
	With more work from homes using different virtual reality settings, there are a few apparent strengths. First there is a “lower overhead cost” (Hartford). This is accomplished by using virtual laboratories, offices, workspaces, and equipment. This is extremely good for development of products as they can save a lot of money testing a new engine or the cabins of aircraft without having to build it. Also there is an increase of “satisfied employees” (Hartford). Many times employees are trying to find “flexible hours” in the workforce to get along with their everyday life (Hartford). With VR, working from home as well as anywhere on the go can be achieved with ease. We also can see businesses increase “scalability” (Hartford). With lower overhead costs and less space being used by the company, increasing staff becomes cheaper and easier allowing the company to grow faster.
  There are also weaknesses. One weakness is lower “cohesion” (Hartford). Though the flexible hours can be great for employees, allowing a “virtual team to mostly choose their own work hours” can “fragment” or destroy organization (Hartford). Furthermore “lack of camaraderie” can affect the efficiency of teamwork because there is little social interaction (Hartford). Finally, there is also a security risk involved with VR and remote workspaces. Having confidential data being accessed or stored remotely can create risky security for projects or client information.
  Using VR in the workfield could lead to an increase of productivity as well as an increase in the growth of companies. It can also lead to a quicker and more interactive development process. However wide scale VR in the workforce can have some adverse psychological factors come into play. Even though there would be better communication, workers using VR are more likely to become “anti-social and insular as a result of over-reliance on VR” (Positive Negative Effects). Though currently there are little to no regulations impacting how businesses and their employees use their VR technology, companies should consider the welfare of their employees when using the technology for long periods of time.
  With each company using CAVE’s, each workspace will be an unique masterpiece perfectly crafted to allow the company to thrive and develop. VR will also change how employees learn and are trained in each of their job fields. As VR continues to add to the workforce we can expect an increase of productivity and growth allowing us to advance and exceed in the workforce.
